I had some code left over from an old interview and I figured I might as well expand on it to showcase my Android knowledge and coding style. This project is (and will always remain) open source. Feel free to fork it, contribute to it, etc. you can email at julian.currie@gmail.com.
This README will be update as new features are added and tweaked.

## How Fizz Buzz Game works

 * A random number is generated after every guess
 * The number is only divisible by 3 (Fizz), 5 (Buzz), or both
 * If the user picks the correct option, "Correct!" is displayed
 * If the user picks the wrong option, "Wrong!" is displayed

## How Fizz Buzz Search works

 * If a number is divisible by 3, print 'fizz'
 * If a number is divisible by 5, print 'buzz'
 * If a number is divisible by both 3 & 5, print 'fizzbuzz'
 * If none of the previous conditions are true, do not print anything.
